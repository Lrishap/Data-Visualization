Background:
Jupyter notebook for creating the parameter space for Dark Higgs being produced from Exotic Higgs decays and B meson decays during proton-proton collisions 
at the ATLAS detector. The proposed ADAM detector is designed to be placed above the exisiting ATLAS detector. The geometrical acceptance of the ADAM detector
was obtained using the Pythia8 simulations. 

Parameters:
The Parameters (lifetime, branching fraction, number of events) for the Dark Higgs bosons needed for the Pythia8 simulations are shownin /Parameters for Pythia8

Data Points:
The data points for the parameter space sin^2_theta vs m_phi was obtained using Pythia8 simulations for Dark Higgs being produced from Exotic Higgs decays and 
B meson decays during proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV center of mass energies assuming LHC Run 4 scenarios. 

Curve Spline Interpolation:
The data points was used to obtain the parameter space sin^2_theta vs m_phi for both prodcution mechanisms using Curve Spline Interpolation in Python. The smooth
curve shows the region of space that is covered by ADAM for the model constraints of the Dark Higgs boson production mechanisms.
